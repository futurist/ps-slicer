Creative Cloud Scripts
---------

Various scripts for Creative Cloud (fka Creative Suite) tools organized in a very simple framework.

Scripts are organized by software (Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash Proâ€¦). Inside each folder is a series of utilities declared as top-level object, usually defined inside function closures. 

Subfolders contain ready-to-use scripts. When available, end users should *always* use the compiled `jsxbin` version of the scripts since it includes dependencies.
