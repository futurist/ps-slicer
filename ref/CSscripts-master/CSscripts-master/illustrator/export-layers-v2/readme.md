#Layer Exporter

Scripts used for Illustrator layer data extraction and image export.

They were meant to be used in the context of the Layer Exporter Panel, loaded in their compiled JSXBIN form (see the panel source repo for more informations).

However, it can still be used directly if you carefully respect the dependency tree. See tester.jsx for a sample.
