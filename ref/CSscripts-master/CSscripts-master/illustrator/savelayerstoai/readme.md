# Save Layers to ai files

This script saves each layer of an .ai file to its own, separate .ai file. By default, the content (aka page items) of the original layer will be transformed to layers itself in the new file, so that this script can be used recursively.

This script can be useful in integration processes where only top level layers are considered (such as when working between AfterEffects and Illustrator or using Illustrator Layer Exporter).
