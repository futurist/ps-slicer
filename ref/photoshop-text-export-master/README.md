## Photoshop Text Export

This is a Photoshop Script that will allow you to export all of the text layers from your PSD along with their font styles.

Currently the script does not support multiple font styles on one text layer.

This is based on the 'PS_BRAMUS Text Export 1.3' script from [bram.us](http://www.bram.us/2008/03/16/ps_bramustextexport-13-automatically-export-all-text-layers-from-photoshop-psd-to-a-text-file/)


### Installation

1. Copy `Text Export.jsx` to your Photoshop Scripts folder (`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/`)
2. Start (or Re-launch) Photoshop
3. Go to the `File` menu
4. Go to the `Script` menu
5. Click `Text Export` and select a place to save your output

This might not work in Adobe Photoshop CS6.
