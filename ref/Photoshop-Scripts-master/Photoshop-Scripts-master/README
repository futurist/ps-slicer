This repo contains a handful of scripts I've been working on to make certain
Photoshop tasks easier.  I'll list their basic function below, but see the
comment at the top of each script for more info on features and usage.


Dynamic Script.jsx

A very simple script that makes it easy to test a few lines of javascript in
Photoshop.  You won't find it too helpful unless you write scripts a lot. 


Super Export.jsx

A Photoshop script that lets you save parts of a PSD as separate cropped
files by carefully naming the Photoshop layers.  For example, if you name
a layer "Background.jpg" and run this script, that layer will be saved and
all others will be hidden.



GETTING STARTED (INSTALLATION)

Installing a photoshop script means dropping the script (*.jsx file) into Photoshop's scripts directory.  For me, the path is:

MAC: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts
PC: c:\program files\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Presets\Scripts

So the easiest way to get going is to copy "Super Export.jsx" to:
/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/Super Export.jsx

Once you restart Photoshop, a new menu item will show up in the menu File > Scripts > Super Export.  Just click on that menu item and the script will run.

I made a keyboard shortcut [F5] to run it automatically, Here's how:
1) Choose Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts...
2) Highlight "Super Export" under File > Scripts
3) Click under the 'Shortcut' column and type the [F5] key (or whatever you want)
4) If there are conflicts, choose 'Accept & Continue', otherwise choose 'Accept'

You can also have scripts in subfolders of this directory, so if you're familiar with GIT, want all my scripts, and want easy access to updates you could clone:  git@github.com:bendytree/Photoshop-Scripts.git to /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/BendyTree  and whenever you want an update, just do a 'git pull' from that directory.  Photoshop gracefully ignores non .jsx files (like .gitignore and readme).
